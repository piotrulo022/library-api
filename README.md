# ðŸ“š Library Management API

A simple REST API for managing a library system.  
This project provides functionality for library staff to track and update the status of books in the libraryâ€™s collection.

---

## Features

The API allows staff to:

-  **add a new book**  
-  **remove a book**  
-  **retrieve a list of all books**  
-  **update book status** (mark as borrowed/available)

## Tech Stack
- **uv**
- **Python 3.12**  
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker & docker-compose**
- **Pytest**

## Installation & Running
Make sure you have **docker** and **docker compose** installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-api.git
cd library-api
docker compose up --build
```

For configuration inspect `docker-compose.yml`. By default port **5432** is mapped for database, **8000** for API. 

The database tables will be created automatically on first run and populated with sample data (see `database/init.sql`).
